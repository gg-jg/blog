# Silicon Milkroundabout

A couple weeks ago now the JustGiving Tech team attended Silicon Milkroundabout, to establish our presence in the London tech scene and to capture some of the excitement of the day. 

In this post I’ll briefly describe what the day is all about and why you would want to attend this awesome event. Hopefully it gives confidence to any devs/companies who are wanting to attend SMR in 2020.

### What is it?
Silicon Milkroundabout is the biggest tech recruitment fair in the UK, where companies and individuals meet in almost a speed dating ritual, with free coffee (as much as you can drink), and so much swag on offer you need a 20 L duffle bag to carry it all home.

### Who attends?
A ton of companies and individuals attend SMR, you’ll find companies such as MI5, Amazon, Lush (the guys who make those soaps), among others and of course JustGiving were there this year too. Most companies tend to bring swag and tech toys to play with, but that isn’t the real reason they’re there. We all have one goal in mind and that’s to find the best of the best devs. 

As an individual attending SMR, you’ll find a range of jobs being advertised by not only the hand full of companies mentioned above, but also from digital agencies looking for DevOps, Front-end and Back-end devs, Data Engineers/Scientists to project managers. Think of a tech role and at least one company will be recruiting for it. Just don’t ask MI5 what they’re recruiting for! \#secretsquirrels. 


### Why should I attend?
From both sides of the company and individual, think of SMR as getting rid of those recruitment agencies, who always promise the delivery of a unicorn that farts rainbows, and getting that first face to face chat with great talent and/or companies (granted not all agencies do that, and not all unicorns fart out rainbows). 

Not only do you get to meet amazing companies and talent, but it’s a great place to practice or improve your soft skills, bounce ideas off other likeminded devs, network, and just get a feel of what is actually happening in the London/UK tech scene.


### What should I bring?  
Bring Your Best Self (a JustGiving core value), that doesn’t mean wearing a suit and having a fresh cut-throat shave on the morning of attending. 

But it does mean preparing business cards and / or an up to date CV, do your research of the companies that are hiring. If you can’t find that information before you attend, everyone, on the day, gets a booklet of all the companies attending, find the ones you like / take your interest and target those.
Practice what you want to say to the companies to increase your sale-ability, remember, this is almost like a mini interview, so to stand our from the rest, you have to nail your opening lines (with a firm handshake). Ask questions about the roles they’re hiring for, make sure you listen to what the companies are saying, and don’t be nervous, we all have to go through this experience at some point in our career.


### What can I expect?
Swag, swag, swag; endless supply of free coffee; great food stalls; arcade games; live music; chill out zones, “influential leaders” talks (James Mitchell for our Platform Engineering Team represented) and lets not forget the amazing companies and talent you will be interacting with potentially losing your voice later that day (after all that sweet talking).
